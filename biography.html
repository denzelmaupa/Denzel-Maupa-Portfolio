        <h3>ABOUT DENZEL MAUPA, IN A NUTSHELL.</h3>
        <p>Hey there! Call me El. Born and bred in the small city of Kwekwe, Zimbabwe, I am a creative in nature, a
            Christian in spirit, and a lover of humans at heart. I came into this world in 2002, December 8th, and on
            that
            day, I met my twin brother, <a href="https://dylan-maupa-portfolio.netlify.app" target="_blank">Dylan</a>.
            We have been the best
            of friends ever since. Over the years, I got to grow up around both my parents, an older brother, two baby
            sisters, and since 2016, a baby brother, and that is a blessing I can never be grateful enough for. Because
            of
            church, I was able to express myself through music, and I learnt about it at a fairly young age. Since then,
            in
            music is where I created the most. I loved sketching and drawing with my best friend (not my twin brother,
            lol)
            who I met in first grade, and I loved public speaking and speech writing in high school. As far as tapping
            into
            my creative side is considered, that's how I did most of that. On top of all that, I was a tech fanatic.
            Like
            the geekiest kind. I started learning code, designing and building applications at 15, though I'm sure I
            would
            have started sooner if I had the resources. All of that summed up led me into taking a career in design.
            Preferrably UI/UX. The first time I heard about it was just after high school, in 2022, and I started
            learning
            about it at a local NGO in the capital of Zimbabwe, called <a href="https://www.uncommon.org"
                target="_blank">Uncommon.org</a>
            and because of them, I have been able to find foundation after attending their year-long bootcamp which they
            offered at the time. Having a career that begs to bring out the tech savvy, self-expressive, geeky creative
            in
            me is probably going to be the best decision I'll ever make.</p>
